# blockchain-developer-bootcamp-final-project
Final project for the Ethereum developer bootcamp 2021


I am thinking for my final project to be a polling application. Its interface will appear like the message board of twitter, however, instead of twitter it will be polls. Polls can be uploaded by users and voted on by an address only 1 time. In order to prevent one individual spamming his response from 1000 different addresses it will most likely require a small toll to place your vote. The goal of this porject is to create a transparent polling service that is run by the people. This way we know that we can trust the final results.

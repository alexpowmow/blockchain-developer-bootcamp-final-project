# blockchain-developer-bootcamp-final-project
Final project for the Ethereum developer bootcamp 2021


I originally posted an idea but when it came time to develop I changed my mind. The new idea I came up with is called Zoodle Clicker Dapp. This is a simple blockchain game. The user will use a clicker to accumulate Zoodle. A smart contract will be in charge of storing the users progress on chain. Everyitme a user wants to purchase an upgrade, it is logged in the blockchain. If a user wants to save or load their progress it is also logged in the blockchain. This allows the user to save their data, close out the tab and load back up their progress at a new point in time.
